# MMS Face Shield

This is a face shield being produced by [Milwaukee Makerspace](https://milwaukeemakerspace.org/).

Our design is based on v3 of the 3DVerkstan design, North American 6 hole version:

We have modified the frame to be cut from 1/4" HDPE on a CNC router. HDPE (High-density Polyethylene) is often used for cutting boards and high-touch surfaces.

The shield will be stamped from 0.01" thick rigid clear vinyl. (We originally planned to cut with a drag knife on our CNC machine but we have found local companies that have offered to create a die and stamp them for us.)

Because of our material choices it will be easy to clean & sanitize these face shields. We're also facing a shortage of PETG sheets, so using clear vinyl that was available to us was a good option.

## Frame

The frame is cut from 1/4" HDPE sheets on a CNC router. (Note: HDPE cannot be cut on a laser cutter, but it is a great material for milling.)

## Shield

The shield files are 8 1/2" x 11". If you can source letter size plastic you can find a variety of options for adding the holes. (The rounded corners at the bottom are not required, but are nice to have as they help prevent snagging the corner of the shield on something.)

## Cleaning

Please see the included PDF file with instructions for cleaning this reusable face shield.
