# MMS Face Shield

This is a face shield being produced by [Milwaukee Makerspace](https://milwaukeemakerspace.org/) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.

Our design is based on v3 of the 3DVerkstan design, North American 6 hole version:

We have modified the frame to be cut from 1/4" HDPE on a CNC router. HDPE (High-density Polyethylene) is often used for cutting boards and high-touch surfaces.

_(Note: As of 2020-04-20 we have switched to using injection molding. More info below.)_

The shield will be stamped from 0.01" thick rigid clear vinyl. (We originally planned to cut with a drag knife on our CNC machine but we have found local companies that have offered to create a die and stamp them for us.)

Because of our material choices it will be easy to clean & sanitize these face shields. We're also facing a shortage of PETG sheets, so using clear vinyl that was available to us was a good option.

## Frame (CNC)

The frame is cut from 1/4" HDPE sheets on a CNC router using a 1/8" single flute spiral upcut endmill. (Note: HDPE cannot be cut on a laser cutter, but it is a great material for milling.)

## Frame (Injection Molded)

We have added the STEP file (Frame-Injection-Molding-v7.step) as we have moved to an injection molded version of the frame. This version may help if you are looking at doing injection molding. We are using HDPE plastic for our injection molded frames. We can easily produce 2000+ frames per day and the mold should be able to produce 200,000 frames during its lifetime.

We've also included an STL file (Frame-Injection-Molding-v7.stl) _for reference only!_ We make no gurantees as to the accuracy of the STL file for use beyond anything more than as a test print.

## Shield

The shield files are 8 1/2" x 11". If you can source letter size plastic you can find a variety of options for adding the holes. (The rounded corners at the bottom are not required, but are nice to have as they help prevent snagging the corner of the shield on something.)

## Cleaning

Please see the included PDF file with instructions for cleaning this reusable face shield.
